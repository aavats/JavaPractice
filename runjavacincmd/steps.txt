1. write java code in notepad

3.open cmd
4. you can change the drive by simply writing the nme with :
5. example if you are in C drive by default, write E: to navigate to your java file
6. next step is to make the current directory the one where your java file is saved
7.whem i made this notepad file, i had saved my java HelloWorld file in E:\>MyJava>

Types of errors I faced
1. At first the java bin folder was not found
2. I went to control panel and set the value of environment path variable as the location of jdk 1.8.101
3.then too I was facing the same error
4. in cmd I wrote set path=address of bin folder of jdk
5. error resolved
6. next I was getting an eror in java interpreter, where the interpreter was not able to load main class file
7. that was happening because in my java code I has a package imported
8. when you have a package imported 
It must be called with its fully-qualified name:

java -classpath . thepackagename.TheClassName
9. I removed the package import statement from the code and then called the interpreter
10. SUCCESS.
